Iâ€™m a third-year computer science student in the College of Engineering whose interests include computer security and web development. Currently, I am doing research for the [Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/) here at UCSB.

During summer of 2016, I interned at [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) in San Francisco, where I was part of the Weebly Cloud team. My work there included improving the stability of the Weebly Cloud service, writing two open-source libraries for the Weebly Cloud API, and developing a new employee directory web app for internal use. This summer, I will be interning at Facebook.

The best thing about my time pursuing computer science at UCSB has been the sense of community. Students are committed to helping each other succeed, whether through tutoring lower division classes or through staying at the computer lab until midnight while a friend debugs an assignment. Prospective students should know that UCSB is an environment where they will be supported and encouraged by both faculty and their peers.
